This project focuses on detecting fake, spammer, and genuine Instagram accounts using machine learning techniques and Python. It involves collecting and analyzing user profile data such as followers/following ratio, post frequency, bio content, and engagement metrics. With the help of libraries like Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, the data is cleaned, visualized, and used to train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest). The goal is to accurately classify accounts based on behavioral patterns, helping to improve social media authenticity and security.
